Police-Women-Safety Dashboard
Project Description
The Police-Women-Safety dashboard is a web-based application aimed at enhancing women's safety through real-time monitoring, detection, and reporting systems. The dashboard provides tools for identifying potential threats, analyzing gender distribution, monitoring hotspot areas, and alerting authorities to unsafe situations. This project focuses on using technology to contribute to women's safety.

Features
Person Detection with Gender Identification: Detects individuals and identifies their gender in real-time.
Gender Distribution Monitoring: Analyzes the distribution of genders in different locations.
Identification of Women Alone at Odd Times: Tracks when women are alone in potentially unsafe situations.
Gesture Analytics: Detects suspicious or alarming gestures to trigger alerts.
Real-time Threat Detection: Monitors areas for potential threats using anomaly detection.
Hotspot Identification: Locates areas that are high-risk based on previous incidents.
Real-time Alerts: Sends alerts to law enforcement or other authorities for quick intervention.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Real-Time Communication: WebSockets
Gender Detection API: Custom or third-party APIs (optional)
Anomaly Detection: Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
